Steps to Build this Demo
========================
Note: The order of these steps is important
1. Right-click on CppLibrary project and select build
2. Right-click on Shim project and select build
3. Right-click on WPF project and select build

If you get build failures, that's probably because you don't have the latest SDK version installed.
You can either:
1. open each of the three project's properties and set the SDK version to one you have
   - you just select from the drop-down list
or:
2. Update your IDE:
   - Tools > Extensions and Updates > Updates
     Note that this takes a while to complete
